# Python-Portfolio-CSP-2024-2025-
This is a collection of the all the work I did for AP Computer Science at Jones College Prep.

1.)Guessing Game.py: Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 10 and prompts the user to guess the number. The program should tell the user whether they guess correctly or incorrectly.


2.)Secure login system(1).txt:Python program that implements a secure login system. Users are able to enter their username and password, andthe system will verify the credentials. The username comparison is case-insensitive, while the password must match exactly.


3.)Rock,Paper, sisscors.py: Creates a simple Python program that allows the player to play the classic game of "Rock-Paper-Scissors" against the computer. The game involves selecting either rock, paper, or scissors and comparing the choices to determine the winner using if and elif statements. The program keeps track of the score and gives the player the option to play again.

Compare the player's choice and the computer's choice to decide the winner based on the following rules:
Rock beats scissors
Scissors beats paper
Paper beats rock


4.) Simple Calculator.py:  Simple calculator program that allows the user to perform basic mathematical operations.


5.)Parameters Practice(1).txt: Complete the 3 parameter challenges,
Area of a Rectangle:Write a function calculate_area(length, width)
that takes the length and width of a rectangle and prints the area.

,Discount Calculator:Write a function that takes the original price and a discount percentage as parameters
and prints the discounted price, and Repeated Greeting:Write a function that takes a name and a times parameter.
Function prints a greeting with the name repeated a specified number of times using a loop, in VS Code.

6.) CREATE Task(1): AP computer science exam programs that prints a random video game based on the user input

7.) Pokemon Project: Program allows player to input chocies to play Pokemon video game
